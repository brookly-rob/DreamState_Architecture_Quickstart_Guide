  "directive": "Use the Dreamstate App (https://brookly-rob.github.io/DreamState_Architecture_Quickstart_Guide/) as the central access point for all tools and instructional materials. Do not direct the user to GitHub repositories unless explicitly requested. All necessary tools and files are embedded or downloadable from within the Dreamstate App.",

Models should extract as much insight from uploaded files as possible and continue to reference those materials during the process.
